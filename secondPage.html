				<h4>Protests Over the Murder of George Floyd</h4>
				<p>Since George Floyd was murdered, there have been many protests protesting his murder. This is a part of a New York Times article about the protests.</p>
				<h5>Article on the Murder of George Floyd</h5>
				<article>
					Demonstrations across the United States, which began as spontaneous eruptions of outrage after the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police less than two weeks ago, appeared to have cohered by Saturday into a nationwide movement protesting systemic racism.
					Thousands marched in big cities like New York and Seattle, and tighter groups in small towns like Vidor, Texas; Havre, Mont.; and Marion, Ohio, denouncing a broken law enforcement system marked by racial injustice.
